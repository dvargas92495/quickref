    THE LITTLE PRINCE <p></p><p></p>

    Antoine De Saint-Exupery<p></p><p></p> 
    
    Antoine de Saint-Exupery, who was a French author, journalist and pilot wrote 
    The Little Prince in 1943, one year before his death. <p></p><p></p>
   
    The Little Prince appears to be a simple children’s tale, 
    some would say that it is actually a profound and deeply moving tale, 
    written in riddles and laced with philosophy and poetic metaphor. <p></p><p></p>
    
    Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from 
    Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an 
    animal. Here is a copy of the drawing. <p></p><p></p>
    
    In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they 
    are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.” I 
    pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a coloured 
    pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: <p></p><p></p>
    
    I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. 
    But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?” My drawing was not 
    a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown- 
    ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa 
    constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. <p></p><p></p>
    
    My Drawing Number Two looked like this: <p></p><p></p>

    The grown-ups’ response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa 
    constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, 
    history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a 
    magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number 
    One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is 
    tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them. <p></p><p></p>
    
    So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot air-planes. I have flown a little over all 
    parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can 
    distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. In the 
    course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been 
    concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen 
    them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn’t much improved my opinion of them. <p></p><p></p>
    
    Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of 
    showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this 
    was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: “That is a 
    hat.” Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I 
    would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and 
    neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man. <p></p><p></p>
    
    So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my 
    plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had 
    with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all 
    alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a 
    week. <p></p><p></p>
    
    The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I 
    was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can 
    imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. <p></p><p></p>
    
    It said: “If you please, draw me a sheep!” <p></p><p></p>
    
    “What!” <p></p><p></p>
    
    “Draw me a sheep!” <p></p><p></p>
